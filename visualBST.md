Given the following data
```3,1,4,6,9,2,5,7```
a binary search tree will look as follows:
```
        3
    /      \
  1          4
    \       /  \
      6    2    9
    /   \
  5       7
```

If the ROOT gets deleted,
the binary search tree changes like so:
```
        2
    /      \
  1          4
    \         \
      6        9
    /   \
  5       7
```
